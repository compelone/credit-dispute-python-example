Dear {credit_bureau_name}:
Please be advised that you are reporting the wrong ssn information on my credit report.  I am in the process of a new loan transaction and the error is causing a problem with my credit scores reporting properly, so any help you can give me with updating this information as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated.
My current social security number:  {current_ssn}
Please remove the following ssn(s) from my report as they do not belong to me and are being reported in error:
Wrong social security number:  {wrong_ssn}
I will await an updated copy of my credit report to reflect these changes.
Thanking you in advance.
Sincerely,
{name}
