Dear {credit_bureau_name}:
Please be advised that you are reporting the wrong job information on my credit report.  I am in the process of a new loan transaction and the error is causing a problem with my credit scores reporting properly, so any help you can give me with updating this information as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated.
My current job is:  {current_job}
Please remove the following job(s) from my report as they do not belong to me and are being reported in error:
Wrong job:  {wrong_job}
I will await an updated copy of my credit report to reflect these changes.
Thanking you in advance.
Sincerely,
