Dear {credit_bureau_name}:
Please be advised that you are reporting the wrong address information on my credit report.  I am in the process of a new loan transaction and the error is causing a problem with my credit scores reporting properly, so any help you can give me with updating this information as soon as possible would be greatly appreciated.
My current address is:  {current_address}
Please remove the following address(es) from my report as they do not belong to me and are being reported in error:
Wrong Address:  {wrong_addresses}
I have included proof of my current address and previous addresses where available, and proof of my social security number for your review.  I will await an updated copy of my credit report to reflect these changes.
Thanking you in advance.
Sincerely,
{name}
